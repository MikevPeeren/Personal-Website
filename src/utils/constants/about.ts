                venture into the nature in the neighborhood. We also love to take her on our holidays, for example to Austria. On the picture you can see her running in the snow which she enjoys big time. We've also taken her to a
                special Hotel in Mayrhofen, Austria that is specifically made for dachshunds where she has made new dachshund friends. It was during this holiday that I proposed to my wife on top of the Krimml waterfalls.`;

                An other thing that I enjoy doing is BBQ, during summer and winter time. I often make slow cook recipes, like Ribs which have to stay on the BBQ for about 6 hours. Or I wake up at the crack of dawn to prepare Pulled Pork which takes 12 hours at a
                minimum.`;
